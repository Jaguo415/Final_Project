# Final_Project

## Runescape Grand Exchange Analysis & Supervised Machine Learning Bot

### Folder 1. 
We Analyse over 1 year of grand exchange data via the runescape Grand Exchange API. We will be using python to help us looking at historical price's from 10 previous days, in order to try and predict the next day's price.

### Folder 2.
We will be scraping the Runescape World map in order to map out coordinates to instruct our ML model to move in the world state.



### Folder 3.

We will be using a runecrafting bot to create our selected rune.


### Folder 4. 
Link to Tableau Dashboard, Overall summary of our results for the past two weeks of botting.
